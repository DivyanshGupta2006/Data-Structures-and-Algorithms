# Data Structures and Algorithms - implementation in C++
This project contains implementation of all common Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, along with all the basic functionalities associated with them.


Current implementations of data structures include that of - 

``` 
    -> Linked List
    -> Doubly Linked List
    -> Circular Linked List
    -> Circular Doubly Linked List
    -> Stack using array
    -> Stack using LinkedList
    -> Queue using array
    -> Queue using LinkedList
    -> Stack using Queue
    -> Queue using Stack
    -> Doubly-ended Queue
    -> Priority Queue
    -> Heap
    -> Binary Search Tree
    -> AVL Tree
    -> 2-3-4 Tree
```

Current implementations of algorithms include that of -

``` 
    -> Bubble sort
    -> Heap sort
    -> Quick sort
    -> Merge sort
    -> Insertion sort
    -> Selection sort
```

There is a test directory which contains code for testing functionalities of all the defined data structures and algorithms.

The src folder contains solutions of some of the common questions involving these data structures as well as algorithms.

There is also a main.cpp file which can be used to use these defined headers.
