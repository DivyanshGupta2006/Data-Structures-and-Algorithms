# Data Structures and Algorithms - implementation in C++
This project contains implementation of all common Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, along with all the basic functionalities associated with them.


Current implementations include that of - 

``` 
    -> Linked List
    -> Doubly Linked List
    -> Circular Linked List
    -> Circular Doubly Linked List
    -> Stack using array
    -> Stack using LinkedList
    -> Queue using array
    -> Queue using LinkedList
    -> Stack using Queue
    -> Queue using Stack. 
```


There are also some cpp files containing applications of various data structures - like test.cpp, and expression_conversion.cpp.
