# Data Structures and Algorithms - implementation in C++
This project contains implementation of all common Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, along with all the basic functionalities associated with them.


Current implementations of data structures include that of - 

``` 
    -> Linked List
    -> Doubly Linked List
    -> Circular Linked List
    -> Circular Doubly Linked List
    -> Stack using array
    -> Stack using LinkedList
    -> Queue using array
    -> Queue using LinkedList
    -> Stack using Queue
    -> Queue using Stack
    -> Heap
    -> Doubly-ended Queue
    -> Priority Queue
    -> Binary Tree
    -> Binary Search Tree
```

Current implementations of algorithms include that of -

``` 
    -> Bubble sort
    -> Heap sort
    -> Quick sort
    -> Merge sort
    -> Insertion sort
    -> Selection sort
```

There is a test directory which contains code for testing functionalities of all the defined data structures and algorithms.


There is also a main.cpp file which can be used to use these defined headers.
